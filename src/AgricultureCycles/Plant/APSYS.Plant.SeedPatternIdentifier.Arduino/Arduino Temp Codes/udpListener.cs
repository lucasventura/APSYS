/* 
* The purpose of this program is to provide a minimal example of using UDP to 
* receive data.
* It picks up broadcast packets and displays the text in a console window.
* This was created to work with the program UDP_Minimum_Talker.
* Run both programs, send data with Talker, receive the data with Listener.
* Run multiple copies of each on multiple computers, within the same LAN of course.
* If the broadcast packet contains numbers or binary data or anything other than 
* plain text it may well crash and burn. 
* Adding code to handle unexpected conditions such as that would defeat the 
* simplistic nature of this example program. So would adding code for a gracefull
* exit. Just kill it.
